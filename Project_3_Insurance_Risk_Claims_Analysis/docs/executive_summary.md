# Executive Summary — Insurance Risk & Claims Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing insurance policy and claims data using Power BI to identify key risk patterns, claim drivers, and customer behavior insights. The objective is to support data-driven decision-making for insurance underwriting, risk management, and claims optimization.

The dashboard provides a consolidated view of total policies, claim amounts, claim frequency, and average claim value, enabling stakeholders to quickly assess overall business performance.

## Key Business Insights

- Total policies analyzed exceed 37,000, with a total claim amount of approximately $187.8 million.
- Private car usage contributes significantly higher claim amounts compared to commercial usage.
- Certain car manufacturers such as Ford, Chevrolet, and Toyota generate the highest total claim values.
- Urban and highly urban zones show relatively higher claim exposure compared to rural areas.
- Middle-aged policyholders (ages 26–65) account for the highest claim amounts.
- Claims increase noticeably for policyholders with dependent children driving.
- Education level and marital status demonstrate clear variation in claim behavior, with single and married customers contributing the highest claim values.
- Long-term trends indicate a steady rise in claim amounts over vehicle manufacturing years, reflecting inflation and increased repair costs.

## Business Recommendations

- Strengthen risk-based pricing for high-claim car makes and urban coverage zones.
- Introduce targeted underwriting rules for customers with young or dependent drivers.
- Optimize policy premiums based on age group and education-based risk segmentation.
- Leverage historical claim trends to forecast future liabilities and improve reserve planning.

This project demonstrates practical applications of business intelligence, data modeling, and analytics for insurance risk assessment and operational optimization.

- Specific car makes contribute disproportionately to total claim value.
- Claim frequency increases significantly with dependent drivers.
- Middle-aged policyholders generate the highest overall claims.
- Education level and marital status show meaningful variations in claim patterns.
- Long-term vehicle trends reflect increasing claim costs over time.
